# KituraKit -  A Kitura v2 Client Library

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/KituraKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM-Swift/KituraKit)

[Kitura](http://kitura.io) is a lightweight web framework for creating complex web routes for web applications.

KituraKit allows developers to use Swift 4's Codable protocol in their front and back end applications and use the same code on the front and backend. 

It also provides a Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) API to make calls to servers easy and as swift-y as possible.
